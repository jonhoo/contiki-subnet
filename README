This fork of Contiki implements a library and networking components to provide a
publish-subscribe layer for applications.

See the example applications in subnet/sink.c and subnet/node.c for reference
implementations.

A full description, analysis and evaluation of the middleware can be found at:

The Contiki Operating System

Contiki is an open source operating system that runs on tiny low-power
microcontrollers and makes it possible to develop applications that
make efficient use of the hardware while providing standardized
low-power wireless communication for a range of hardware platforms.

Contiki is used in numerous commercial and non-commercial systems,
such as city sound monitoring, street lights, networked electrical
power meters, industrial monitoring, radiation monitoring,
construction site monitoring, alarm systems, remote house monitoring,
and so on.
